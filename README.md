==================
It's not worth trying to support POJOs. You just end up with more code. Also I tried it and the well-known xml to json mappers didn't work. One lesser-known one seemed to cause an infinite recursion.

I have the maven project one because sometimes I'm experimenting with new libraries and maven makes it easy to get them.
